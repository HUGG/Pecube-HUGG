Pecube-HUGG
===========

This is a repository for the HUGG version of the thermokinematic and thermochronometer age prediction program Pecube. The code was forked from Pecube version 3.0, distributed by Jean Braun in September 2010.

Inversion using the Neighbourhood Algorithm
-------------------------------------------

If performing inversions of thermochronometer data using the [Neighbourhood Algorithm](http://rses.anu.edu.au/~malcolm/na/), be aware that as described in the software package, use of the Neighbourhood Algorithm is restricted to non-commercial research and teaching. Any commercial use requires explicit written permission. More information about the Neighbourhood Algorithm and its use can be found on the [Neighbourhood Algorithm web page](http://rses.anu.edu.au/~malcolm/na/).
