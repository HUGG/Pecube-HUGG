Pecube-HUGG
===========

This is a repository for the Helsinki University Geodynamics Group (HUGG) version of the thermokinematic and thermochronometer age prediction program Pecube (Pecube-HUGG).
The HUGG version of Pecube was forked from Pecube version 3.0, distributed by Jean Braun in September 2010.

Data inversion using the Neighbourhood Algorithm
------------------------------------------------

If performing inversions of thermochronometer data using the [Neighbourhood Algorithm](http://rses.anu.edu.au/~malcolm/na/), be aware that as described in the software package, use of the Neighbourhood Algorithm is restricted to non-commercial research and teaching.
Any commercial use requires explicit written permission.
More information about the Neighbourhood Algorithm and its use can be found on the [Neighbourhood Algorithm web page](http://rses.anu.edu.au/~malcolm/na/).
