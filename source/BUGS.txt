error in arguments when calling calculate_ages in Pecube.f90 the second time
(ie when calculating ages at observation points) K and B were inverted.

---------------------
Thursday 14/10/2010
error in arguments when calling find_velocity in testFault.f90 the
second time it is called. Some arguments (xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax) are
missing

same thing for arguments of the routine move_fault when called in Pecube
and in testFault

Error when writing the information to the binary file containing the Tt information
for the observed locations (see Christoph email for further explanation)

--------------------
Monday 21/02/2011
error in interpolation of temperature when stretching the grid that led to inaccuracies along
one side of the model. 

--------------------
Monday 20/3/2011
error when points where advected far from the box due to fault movement; this caused
problems when the code was trying to interpolate the Temperature on these points

--------------------
Monday 20/3/2011
change to the code with the addition of a C-routine to simplify the output to the
screen during Pecube run

--------------------
Monday 20/3/2011
change to allow for 0 faults in the input/fault_parameters.txt input file when
the velocity is limited to uplift specified by four points at the corner of the box
